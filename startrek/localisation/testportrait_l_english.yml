 pc_H_Class:0 "Class H Planet"
 pc_H_Class_desc:0 "Class H planets have a hot and arid surface, with little or no surface water and an atmosphere that might contain heavy gasses and metal vapors. Lifeforms found on class H planets included drought- and radiation-resistant plant life and similar animal life."
 pc_M1_Class:0 "Class M type 1 Planet"
 pc_M1_Class_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Active and stable hydrosphere. Great landmasses are separated by oceans, with large climate variations depending on latitude and precipitation."
 pc_M2_Class:0 "Class M type 2 Planet"
 pc_M2_Class_desc:0 "Humid, rocky world with a thick nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seasons with significant precipitation are interchanged with drier periods. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation."
 pc_M3_Class:0 "Class M type 3 Planet"
 pc_M3_Class_desc:0 "Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate equatorial regions. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to mosses and lichens." 
 pc_M4_Class:0 "Class M type 4 Planet"
 pc_M4_Class_desc:0 "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce."
 pc_O_Class:0 "Class O Planet"
 pc_O_Class_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere. Oceans cover more than §Y90%§! of the surface, with scattered islands making up the remaining percentage."
 pc_P_Class:0 "Class P Planet"
 pc_P_Class_desc:0 "Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The poles are big, and significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. However, the planet experiences seasonal variations and the equatorial band is covered by vegetation."

 pc_M0_Class:0 "Class M type 0 Planet (Gaia)"
 pc_M0_Class:0 "An ideal, temperate world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a resilient ecosystem. Optimal conditions for all known higher forms of life at different latitudes, especially for humanoids."

 
 pc_K_Class:0"Class K Planet"
 pc_K_Class_desc:0"Class K planets are characterized as being adaptable for Humans by use of pressure domes and life support systems."
 pc_L1_Class:0"Class L type 1 Planet"
 pc_L1_Class_desc:0"Class L type 1 Planets were located within the ecosphere of a star system. They were categorized by a rocky and barren surface with little surface water and an atmosphere of oxygen/argon with a high concentration of carbon dioxide. Native lifeforms were limited to plant life, although the majority of class L planets were suitable for humanoid colonization."
 pc_L2_Class:0"Class L type 2 Planet"
 pc_L2_Class_desc:0"Class L type 2 Planets were located within the ecosphere of a star system. They were categorized by a rocky and barren surface with little surface water and an atmosphere of oxygen/argon with a high concentration of carbon dioxide.
